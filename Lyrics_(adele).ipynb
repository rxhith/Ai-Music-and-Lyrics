kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they\\'re strong\\nBut my knees were far too weak\\nTo stand in your arms\\nWithout falling to your feet But there\\'s a side to you\\nThat I never knew, never knew\\nAll the things you\\'d say\\nThey were never true, never true\\nAnd the games you play\\nYou would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain\\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\\nWell, it burned while I cried\\n\\'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,\\nYour name When I lay with you\\nI could stay there\\nClose my eyes\\nFeel you here forever\\nYou and me together nothing gets better \\'Cause there\\'s a side to you\\nThat I never knew, never knew\\nAll the things you\\'d say\\nThey were never true, never true\\nAnd the games you play\\nYou would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain\\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\\nWell, it burned while I cried\\n\\'Cause I heard it screaming out your name,\\nYour name I set fire to the rain\\nAnd I threw us into the flames\\nWell, it felt something died\\n\\'Cause I knew that that was\\nThe last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door,\\nThat heart you caught must be waiting for you\\nEven now when we\\'re already over\\nI can\\'t help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain\\nWatched it pour as I touched your face\\nWell, it burned while I cried\\n\\'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,\\nYour name I set fire to the rain,\\nAnd I threw us into the flames\\nWell, it felt something died\\n\\'Cause I knew that, that was the last time\\nThe last time Let it burn\\nLet it burn\\nLet it burn Daydreamer\\nSitting on the sea\\nSoaking up the sun\\nHe is a real lover\\nAnd making up the past\\nFeeling up his girl\\nLike he\\'s never felt a figure before A jaw dropper\\nLooks good when he walks\\nIs the subject of their talk\\nHe would be hard to chase\\nBut good to catch\\nAnd he could change the world\\nWith his hands behind his back, oh You can find him sittin\\' on your doorstep\\nWaiting for a surprise\\nAnd he will feel like he\\'s been there for hours\\nAnd you can tell that he\\'ll be there for life Daydreamer\\nWith eyes that make you melt\\nHe lends his coat for shelter\\nPlus he\\'s there for you\\nWhen he shouldn\\'t be\\nBut he stays all the same\\nWaits for you\\nThen sees you through There\\'s no way I\\nCould describe him\\nWhat I\\'ll say is\\nJust what I\\'m hoping for But I will find him sittin\\' on my doorstep\\nWaiting for a surprise\\nAnd he will feel like he\\'s been there for hours\\nAnd I can tell that he\\'ll be there for life\\nAnd I can tell that he\\'ll be there for life With your loving, there ain\\'t nothing\\nThat I can\\'t adore\\nThe way I\\'m running, with you, honey\\nIs we can break every low\\nI find it funny that you\\'re the only\\nOne I never looked for\\nThere is something in your loving\\nThat tears down my walls I wasn\\'t ready then, I\\'m ready now\\nI\\'m heading straight for you\\nYou will only be eternally\\nThe one that I belong to The sweetest devotion\\nHitting me like an explosion\\nAll of my life, I\\'ve been frozen\\nThe sweetest devotion I\\'ve known I\\'ll forever be whatever you want me to be\\nI\\'ll go under and all over for your clarity\\nWhen you wonder if I\\'m gonna lose my way home\\nJust remember, that come whatever, I\\'ll be yours all alone I

feels like home\\nAll my life, you\\'re my darkness\\nYou\\'re the right kind of madness\\nAnd you\\'re my hope, you\\'re my despair\\nYou\\'re my scope, everything, everywhere The sweetest devotion\\nHitting me like an explosion\\nAll of my life, I\\'ve been frozen\\nThe sweetest devotion I\\'ve known Sweetest\\nIt\\'s the sweetest\\nSweetest\\nIt\\'s the sweetest\\nSweetest\\nIt\\'s the sweetest\\nSweetest\\nIt\\'s the sweetest\\nDevotion [Verse 1]\\nWhen did it go wrong, I will never know\\nI have loved you all my life\\nHow did it slow down, I go round and round\\nThinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus]\\nI gave you heaven on a platter baby\\nI gave you everything you never gave me\\nI never lied and I never faked it\\nOnly wanted for you to save me\\nThis love, it ain\\'t over yet\\nThere\\'s too much that I haven\\'t said [Chorus]\\nDid you find the note that I wrote?\\nI hid it in the seam of your coat\\nIt was hard to write, had a lump in my throat\\nDo you even know that I can\\'t let go [Verse 2]\\nWhy were you so cold, let the truth be told\\nTell me was it all for the thrill?\\nWhat was I thinking, I gave you everything\\nBut you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus]\\nI gave you heaven on a platter baby\\nI gave you everything you never gave me\\nI never lied and I never faked it\\nOnly wanted for you to save me [Chorus]\\nDid you find the note that I wrote?\\nI hid it in the seam of your coat\\nIt was hard to write, had a lump in my throat\\nDo you even know that I can\\'t let go [Bridge]\\nOooh sometimes I feel like I\\'m in the dark\\nOooh I thought I\\'d die in your arms [Chorus]\\nDid you find the note that I wrote?\\nI hid it in the seam of your coat\\nIt was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat\\nDo you even know that I can\\'t let go [Outro]\\nHope you know, I won\\'t let go I thought I told you, he\\'d be home soon\\nCouldn\\'t help myself, you\\'re too good to be true.\\nI fall short each time,\\nEvery time he ain\\'t here\\nYou and your charm creep closer\\nCloser and near\\nLike a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all.\\nLike a bomb before explosion,\\nTicking by your call,\\nYou\\'re the wiser one, disguised from greed,\\nAnd I\\'m just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more,\\nThan I ever did you before,\\nSo stand beside the river I cried,\\nAnd lay yourself down.\\nLook how you want me now that I don\\'t need you. So, you thought that I\\'d crumble to my knees\\nAt the first sight of you crawling back to me\\nTo whisper \"will you leave your man? \"\\nCause you swear that this time you can stand by me.\\nI won\\'t stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more,\\nThan I ever did you before,\\nSo stand beside the river I cried\\nAnd lay yourself down.\\nLook how you want me now that I don\\'t need you! I ain\\'t yours for no taking,\\nYou must be mistaken\\nI could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong\\nAnd ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more,\\nThan you ever did me before.\\nSo stand beside the river you cried\\nAnd lay yourself down!\\nLook how you want me now that I don\\'t need you! Found myself today singing out your name,\\nYou said I\\'m crazy,\\nIf I am I\\'m crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here\\nTurns me crazy,\\nBut it\\'s you who makes me lose my head. And every time I\\'m meant to be acting sensible\\nYou drift into my head\\nAnd turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I\\'ll race,\\nIf you want me to stop I\\'ll freeze,\\nAnd if you want me gone. I\\'ll leave, just hold me closer baby,\\nAnd make me crazy for you.\\nCrazy for you. Lately with this state I\\'m in I can\\'t help myself but spin.\\nI wish you\\'d come over,\\nSend me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it\\'s sweet taste for you,\\nStrips me down bare\\nAnd gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,\\nBut the more I do,\\nThe crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors,\\nHoping you\\'ll walk through\\nAnd save me boy,\\nBecause I\\'m too crazy for you.\\nCrazy for you Everybody tells me it\\'s \\'bout time that I moved on\\nAnd I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young\\nBut my heart is a valley, it\\'s so shallow and man made\\nI\\'m scared to death if I let you in that you\\'ll see I\\'m just a fake\\nSometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch\\nBut I know that\\'s just me, \\'cause nothing ever is enough\\nWhen I was a child I grew up by the River Lea\\nThere was something in the water, now that something\\'s in me\\nOh I can\\'t go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips\\nI can\\'t go back to the river But it\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins\\nIt\\'s in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins\\nIt\\'s in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain\\nSo I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea\\nYeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it\\'s way too late\\nThat I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face\\nConsider this my apology, I know it\\'s years in advance\\nBut I\\'d rather say it now in case I never get the chance\\nNo, I can\\'t go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips\\nI can\\'t go back to the river But it\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins\\nIt\\'s in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins\\nIt\\'s in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea\\nYeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea\\nYeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham\\nIf it hadn\\'t been for love\\nI never woulda

by accident\\nIt blew me away\\nBlew me away It was in the darkest of my days\\nWhen you took my sorrow and you took my pain\\nAnd buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you\\nWhen the day is done\\nAnd wake up to your face against the morning sun\\nBut like everything I\\'ve ever known\\nYou disappear one day\\nSo I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station\\nPut a kiss on top of your head\\nWatch you wave\\nAnd watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers\\nAnd neon lights and waiting papers\\nThat I call home\\nI call that home I wish I could lay down beside you\\nWhen the day is done\\nAnd wake up to your face against the morning sun\\nBut like everything I\\'ve ever known\\nYou disappear one day\\nSo I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted\\nI\\'m going back to where I started\\nThe morning rain, the morning rain\\nAnd though I wish that you were here\\nOn that same old road that brought me here\\nIt\\'s calling me home, It\\'s calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you\\nWhen the day is done\\nAnd wake up to your face against the morning sun\\nBut like everything I\\'ve ever known\\nYou disappear one day\\nSo I spend my whole life hiding my heart away\\nI can\\'t spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there\\'s air made of bricks\\nPulls me down turns me weak for you\\nI find myself repeating like a broken tune\\nAnd I\\'m forever excusing your intentions\\nThat I give in to my pretendings\\nWhich forgive you each time\\nWithout me knowing\\nThey melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up\\nYou say my name like there could be an us\\nI best tidy up my head I\\'m the only one in love\\nI\\'m the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave\\nI feel my heart begin to burst and bleed\\nSo desperately I try to link it with my head\\nBut instead I fall back to my knees\\nAs you tear your way right through me\\nI forgive you once again\\nWithout me knowing\\nYou\\'ve burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up\\nYou say my name like there could be an us\\nI best tidy up my head I\\'m the only one in love\\nI\\'m the only one in love Why do you steal my hand\\nWhenever I\\'m standing my own ground\\nYou build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up\\nI say your name like there should be an us\\nI best tidy up my head I\\'m the only one, in love\\nI\\'m the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you\\nAnd fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette\\nAnd my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you\\'d understand\\nAnd thinking you would listen to all of the things\\nThe things I had planned But we couldn\\'t see eye to eye\\nSo darling\\nDarling\\nDarling this is goodbye Oh\\nI still care\\nFool that I am\\nOoh\\nI still care\\nFool that I am You say it\\'s all in my head\\nAnd the things I think just don\\'t make sense\\nSo where you been then? Don\\'t go all coy\\nDon\\'t turn it round on me like it\\'s my fault\\nSee I can see that look in your eyes\\nThe one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\\nYou shower me with words made of knives\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you\\nYou make it look like I\\'m see-through\\nDo tell me why you waste our time\\nWhen your heart ain\\'t in it, and you\\'re not satisfied\\nYou know I know just how you feel\\nI\\'m starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\\nYou shower me with words made of knives\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool\\n(Just for you)\\nEven in the daylight when you think that\\n(I don\\'t see you)\\nTry to look for things I hear but our eyes never find\\nThough I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\\nYou shower me with words made of knives\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her\\nYou shower me with words made of knives\\nWhenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele]\\nWhy do you love me\\nDo you love me...?\\nWhy do you love me\\nDo you love me?\\nWhy do you love me\\nDo you love me?
